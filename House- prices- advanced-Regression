##Objective:
The objective of this project was to predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of 
bedroom and bathrooms."
## summarize key
The  Linear regression model explained approximetely 63% of the variance in house prices showing 
the square footage was the most influential predictor  among the features considered 
## Discuss model perforance of results.
while the model performed resonably well additional featires could further improve accuracy as indicatied by an R-squared valuse of 
0.63
## suggest practical implication
these insights could assist real estate agent in pricing propetices more accureately and guid buyers in assessing the value of homes
based on features
## work or improvement
Feture work could explore additional features such as neighborhood characeristics or amenities and test more complex models to 
imporve pradiction accuracy.
# conclusion:
To summarize, this project aimed to predict house prices using linear regression based on key features: square footage, number of bedrooms,
and number of bathrooms. The model was able to explain 63% of the variance in house prices, showing that square footage had the strongest
influence on price. Although the model performed well, incorporating more features such as neighborhood amenities could enhance its predictive power.
These findings provide a foundation for further analysis and could serve as a valuable tool for real estate professionals in estimating property values."
